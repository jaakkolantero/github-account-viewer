## My thoughts about the project

I should have done some kind of draft with figma before starting. Wasted too much time trying different layouts. Especially lists and pages with lots of data are hard to design in your head. I would've liked to try react-springs v9 beta but didn't have the time. Commits tend to get out of hand in the first stages of project when everything is broken. Github API was straightforward. Rate limits were pain in the ass and I didn't have time to do a proper login functionality. As a work around added OAuth key/secret as query parameters. This way I got increased rate limit.

I haven't used typescript in almost a year but it felt suprisingly easy. I've noticed that I can't live without tailwindcss anymore. It's that good. Dynamic api routes were new thing and they're superb. I really love how project structure reflects the real api.
